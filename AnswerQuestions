1.Fetching all matches is high loading due to we had to read all pages of API receiving all matches because there is a necessary comparing all matches based on 'globalImportance' and 'kickoftime'. To solve that
  It is better to run a service in the server that fetches the matches of API every minute and saves them into the cache systems.
  When a client requests to receive the matches, the server retrieves the matches of the cache and responses to the client.
  So the client doesn't have to wait that the server fetches the matches of API.

2. setlocale(LC_TIME, "de_DE");
   echo strftime(" in German %A.\n");
